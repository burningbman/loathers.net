Over 20 years of the game's existence, there's a ton of extremely powerful pulls you can snag to help speed up your non-hardcore speedruns. Loathers & ASS maintain a [general standard pull list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Polz9Q4EE0p1SiLGLR5UTexKEu_o5y9BoQUb8lad_Mc/edit#gid=770608628), but we don't generally keep one up to date for unrestricted. This page is going to serve as (essentially) a simple list of additional powerful non-standard pulls that can be linked as an addendum to the standard list if you're trying to speedrun a non-standard path. Hope this adds a few items you can consider beyond the best items in the standard sheet!

If you're trying to save turns, these pulls are your best options:

| Pull | Turns Saved |
| ---- | ----------- |
| eldritch elixir or eldritch snap | If you aren't burning all delay, getting eldritch attunement doubles all your non-breathitin free fights into delay burn. That can be 6-8 extra delay burn and a ton of extra familiar turns, which is pretty dope! |
| bottle of blank-out | 5 free runs a day in most paths, for 5 easy-peasy delay burn |
| spooky putty sheet | 5 copies per day; not in delay, like backups or digitize or other things, but it's still five cool copies! | 
| turkey blaster | 5 turns delayburn for 2 spleen; inferior to breathitins, but it's still pretty great in any universe where you aren't burning all delay! | 
| stuffing fluffer | 4-5 turns saved in war, if you don't have thanksgarden. Otherwise, goes down to 2-3 turns saved in a 2-day and 4 turns in a 1-day -- a little better than blaster generally, due to removing turns from  | 
| cornucopia | You can use this to get (often) an extra fluffer/blaster! Heck yeah. | 
| pokegarden seeds | If you have thanksgarden, this is a nice pull to get extra cornucopias. Otherwise, not really useful, just duplicates garden growth. You can get a few extra freekills from rock garden, without Thanksgarden? | 
| cashew | If a single cashew gets you an extra fluffer or cornucopia, this is worth it. Otherwise, it isn't. | 
| gravy boat | As a non-consumable, it's a nice every-now-and-then pull. It shaves 3-4 turns off the whole cyrpt after the big nerf in early 2023. | 
| navel ring / GAP / peppermint parasol | Gives you 3 guaranteed runs... you can also get 3-4 more if you're willing to risk some non-free runs! | 
| replica bat-oomerang | 3 free kills a day; simple, powerful, good. | 
| jokester's gun | One free kill a day -- in a >1 day run, that's good! | 
| clara's bell | One slotless stench jelly a day is nice. It's OK. | 
| infinite bacon machine | 1 free tower key in a 2-day run, otherwise it's... not really great, probably don't pull it! | 

If you need to generate more turns, these pulls are good turn generators.

| Pull | Turns Generated |
| ---- | --------------- |
| Pantsgiving | In unrestricted, 2-3 extra fullness is 14-ish turns, which is solid value; this is obviously an extremely expensive pull, but if you pull it early and keep it equipped long enough, it's self-evidently powerful |
| synthetic dog hair & distention pills | One fullness or drunkenness cleared. It's fine, not great, but relatively cheap, as you can generate 5 per day of one or the other |
| wrecked generator | Really not recommended, but if you're low on IOTMs and need massive turgnen with very little thought, you can pull a wrecked generator. These require preparation prior to your run, because you need to purchase them from the Lunar Lunch-o-Mat and they can't be traded, but I often keep a few around for a lazy large-turngen pull |
| powerful rollover gear | If you're trying to generate turns in a 2+ day run, a piece of rollover gear for a big gob of adventures per day is better than quite a lot of these options; things like Counterclockwise Watch, clockwork maids, lavaco lamps, etc |
| etched hourglass | Flat 5 turns gained. It's fine! Not great, but pretty easy |
| license to chill | Flat 5 turns gained. If you have it, it's better than etched hourglass, but also you're extremely rich! Good for you |
